\chapter{Special Topic: Cosmology}\label{ap:cosmology}

One of the reasons to be interested in the QCD phase diagram is for its
implications regarding the early universe. In particular the universe was
extremely dense and hot, so we expect it was dominated by quark-gluon plasma.

To help orient oneself in research at the intersection of these topics, it is
useful to know some basics about cosmology, which is the goal of this appendix.
It is based off a nice talk given by Laura Sagunski~\cite{sagunski22}.
One can also refer to
Ref.~\cite{weinberg_cosmology_2008,misner_gravitation_1975}
for a more in-depth discussion of cosmology and general relativity.
