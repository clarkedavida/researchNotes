\chapter{Physics: Quantum Field Theories}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics classifies all known
\index{particle!elementary}\index{Standard Model}
{\it elementary particles}, i.e. particles with no known substructure,
and describes three fundamental forces:\index{force!fundamental} the electromagnetic,
weak, and strong forces. Elementary particles can be divided into
\index{particle!matter}
{\it matter particles} (quarks and leptons); {\it gauge bosons}, which mediate
\index{boson!scalar}\index{boson!gauge}
the three aforementioned forces; and a {\it scalar boson}, the Higgs boson,
whose field interacts directly with elementary particles that thereby
acquire their mass. For each particle there exists a corresponding
antiparticle; sometimes a particle is its own antiparticle.
Figure~\ref{fig:SM} gives a schematic overview of the SM.

The theoretical framework underlying the SM is an example of a Quantum 
Field Theory (QFT). QFTs are consistent with both quantum mechanics and
relativity. Lattice gauge theories are a kind of QFT; therefore it is
important for the reader to know a little bit about them. There are a lot
of different resources one can use to learn about QFT; for example when I was a
grad student I used Peskin and Schroeder~\cite{peskin_introduction_1995}
and Srednicki~\cite{srednicki_quantum_2007}.
Nowadays there are also some very high quality lectures on YouTube,
for instance a series by Tong~\cite{tongQFT}, which I found had some other nice
introductory remarks. 
A timeline of particle discoveries can be found in
Ref.~\cite{wiki_particle_discoveries}.

\section{An approximate history of the SM}

% TODO: maybe it would be fun to include a history here
% brief history according to tong
% e.g. how did QFT start? pauli dirac jordan etc 1920s-30s how to quantize
% fields. Start basically along with discovery of QM. Failing to have 
% theory with infinite num of dof, leading into 2nd world war.
% then tomonaga, schwinger, dyson, feynman. Can renormalize, QED discovered.
% 1970s golden age: infinites understood through
% renormalization group wilson and kadanoff. Progress on understanding geometry
% and topology in QFT.

One could argue that the beginning of the SM history coincides with the
beginnings of modern particle physics. Since that depends on unifying
relativity, quantum mechanics, and field theory, one could arguably even take
Maxwell's equations as a starting point. 
There were also many interesting ideas that were not pursued or turned out
not to be correct yet still played some role in the history; I will not
discuss these. In some cases I may miss some discoveries that were also
important but less celebrated.
Given these ambiguities and the fact
that I am not at all a real historian, 
I would rather call what follows an ``approximate" history.

\subsection{Strong sector}\index{interaction!strong}

An atomic nucleus is made of protons and neutrons, i.e. it is made of particles
that have only positive or zero electric charge. Hence for some time, physicists
knew there must be some {\it strong force}\index{force!strong} that opposes
Coulomb repulsion and binds nucleons into nuclei.
Such particles held together by strong interactions are called
{\it hadrons}.\index{hadron} Nowadays we also use the terms {\it meson}
\index{meson} and {\it baryon}\index{baryon} to refer to hadrons made of 
two quarks and three quarks, respectively.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the {\it kaon} ($K$)~\cite{rochester_evidence_1947}
\index{meson!K} and {\it lambda} ($\Lambda$)~\cite{hopper_evidence_1950}
\index{baryon!lambda} hadrons were discovered\footnote{A kaon
consists of light quark and a strange, while a lambda baryon binds two light
quarks with one from a higher generation. {\it Strangeness} \index{strangeness}
was originally proposed as a conserved quantity to explain the relatively long
lifetimes of these particles~\cite{pais_remarks_1952,gell-mann_isotopic_1953,
pais_baryon-meson-photon_1953,tadao_charge_1953}.
We now identify strangeness $S$ as
$$
  S\equiv\#\,\text{anti-strange quarks}-\#\,\text{strange quarks}.
$$}. Ne'eman~\cite{neeman_derivation_1961}, 
Gell-Mann~\cite{gell-mann_symmetries_1962}, and 
Zweig~\cite{zweig_su3_1964} proposed\footnote{Gell-Mann would receive the 1969
Nobel for his contributions to understanding elementary particle
classification.} that these hadrons could be classified
according to the irreducible representations of $\SU(3)$, a viewpoint which
Gell-Mann called the \index{eightfold way}{\it eightfold way}\footnote{This
name is inspired by the eightfold path of Buddhism.}, examples of which are 
illustrated graphically in \figref{fig:eightfold}. Gell-Mann
referred to the fundamental units as {\it quarks}\footnote{Gell-Mann borrows
this name from an excerpt of James Joyce's {\it Finnegan's Wake} that begins
``Three quarks for Muster Mark".
Gell-Mann was a bit of a fanciful guy I guess.}.
At first it was not clear that this quark viewpoint was more than a
purely mathematical construction, however deep inelastic 
scattering\index{scattering!deep inelastic}
experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) showed that
protons are made of smaller particles, and are therefore not 
elementary~\cite{bloom_high-energy_1969,breidenbach_observed_1969}.
This alone did not convince the community that quarks were real, but
subsequent discoveries would solidify the quark model.

           electric charge. Images taken from
           Wikipedia~\cite{wiki_eightfold}.}
  \label{fig:eightfold}
\end{figure}

From here it was shown possible to formulate a QFT for the strong interaction
based on $\SU(3)$~\cite{fritzsch_advantages_1973}, which we
call quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\index{quantum chromodynamics} 
The mediators are called
{\it gluons}\index{gluon} with the adjoint representation delivering
eight possible color combinations.
Gross, Wilczek~\cite{gross_d.j._ultraviolet_1973} and
Politzer~\cite{politzer_reliable_1973} demonstrated 
{\it asymptotic freedom}\footnote{They got the 2004 Nobel for this.}
\index{asymptotic freedom} in this QFT, i.e. they showed that the
strong coupling decreases with increasing interaction strength, which is
consistent with the fact that one does not observe free quarks\footnote{At
least not at typical temperatures and densities.}.
This theoretical observation is buttressed by strong coupling
expansions in the lattice formulation, which show that the potential
energy between two infinitely heavy quarks grows linearly
(see \secref{sec:hqfe}).

We round out this section with a short timeline of discoveries of the
remaining QCD particles. In 1974 the discovery of the 
$J/\Psi$-meson\index{psion} or {\it psion}\footnote{The $J/\Psi$ consists
of a $\bar{c}c$ pair. This is also sometimes called {\it charmonium}.
\index{charmonium}} at both Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) and
SLAC~\cite{augustin_discovery_1974,aubert_experimental_1974} demonstrated
the existence of the charm quark\footnote{Richter and Ting got the 1974
Nobel prize in physics for this.}, adding further evidence to
the validity of the quark model. The $J/\Psi$ discovery marks the beginning of a
period of rapid discoveries in particle physics sometimes referred to as the
``November Revolution".\index{November Revolution} The existence of the bottom
quark was demonstrated in 1977 at Fermilab~\cite{herb_observation_1977} when the 
$Y$-meson\footnote{A $Y$-meson\index{meson!Y} is a $\bar{b}b$ bound state. This is
sometimes called \index{bottomonium}{\it bottomonium}.} was discovered.
In 1979 we found experimental evidence for the
gluon via indirect observations~\cite{barber_discovery_1979} at the
Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). In part because it is the
heaviest quark, the top quark would not be discovered until
1995~\cite{abachi_observation_1995,abe_observation_1995}
at Fermilab.

\subsection{Electroweak and Higgs sectors}\index{interaction!weak}

In the early 1930s, Fermi published\footnote{Apparently he originally attempted
to publish it in {\it Nature}, but they rejected it because
it because ``it contained speculations too remote from reality to be of interest
to the reader".} his theory of $\beta$-decay,
\index{decay!beta} which is any decay emitting an $e^+$ or $e^-$ from
an atomic nucleus, for example
\begin{equation}
  n\to\text{p}+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e.
\end{equation}
His theory was an effective 4-point interaction directly linking the four
particles in the above process.
Shortly thereafter, Yukawa~\cite{yukawa_interaction_1935} put forward that this
interaction should include another field with corresponding quantum that
mediates this interaction\footnote{Nowadays we designate as
{\it Yukawa interaction} any interaction between
Dirac fields and scalar fields of the form\index{interaction!Yukawa}
$g\bar{\psi}\phi\psi$ or $g\bar{\psi}i\gamma_5\phi\psi$.}, 
sort of like how the photon mediates the
electromagnetic interaction. Another salient point of this paper is
the introduction of the {\it Yukawa potential}\index{potential!Yukawa}
giving the potential of a gauge boson of mass $m$:
\begin{equation}
  V(r)=-g^2\frac{e^{-\alpha m r}}{r}.
\end{equation}
Here $g$ is the gauge coupling and $r$ is the interaction range. One sees that
massless gauge bosons have a Coulomb-like potential, while massive ones
are suppressed exponentially\footnote{One can also show that the Fourier
transform of this potential is the propagator, which we will discuss later.}. 
Finally this paper was the first to
postulate the existence of mesons\footnote{And got him the 1949 Nobel prize.}.

In the mid 1950s, Lee and Yang~\cite{lee_question_1956} suggested possible
experimental tests to search for parity violation in weak interaction 
processes\footnote{Lee and Yang won the 1957 Nobel prize for this}.
Shortly thereafter, Wu et al.~\cite{wu_experimental_1957} demonstrated parity
violation in the $\beta$-decay of \ce{^{60}Co}~\cite{wu_experimental_1957},
a result which was verified by Garwin et al.~\cite{garwin_observations_1957}. 
The theory of the weak interaction was extended by Gell-Mann and
Feynman~\cite{feynman_theory_1958} to accommodate parity violation by
introducing vector-axial currents.
That $\beta$-decay proceeds through vector-axial currents was
experimentally verified shortly thereafter~\cite{goldhaber_helicity_1958}.

The unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces began already with
Glashow in 1961~\cite{glashow_partial-symmetries_1961}, where
he puts forward the $\SU(2)\times \U(1)$ symmetry group. 
Still, this theory was not known to be renormalizable.
Also the weak interaction is short range, but this suggests that the mediating boson 
should be massive according to Yukawa. On the other hand, 
massive gauge bosons superficially spoil gauge invariance.

In superconductivity, Ginzburg-Landau theory~\cite{ginzburg_theory_1950}
gives solutions with effective mass. Nambu applied\footnote{2008 Nobel prize.} 
this to particle
physics~\cite{nambu_axial_1960,nambu_dynamical_1961,nambu_dynamical_1961-1},
but this implied the existence of Goldstone modes that are not observed.
Higgs~\cite{higgs_broken_1964} and Brout and Englert~\cite{englert_broken_1964}
noticed\footnote{Higgs and Englert received the 2013 Nobel for this.} 
that by strategically choosing 
the gauge, one can simultaneously
eliminate the Goldstone modes, add a mass term to gauge bosons, and a scalar
boson, the Higgs boson.\index{boson!Higgs}
We will discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking and Goldstone's theorem
\index{spontaneous symmetry breaking} in \secref{sec:ssb}. The Higgs
mechanism is discussed in detail in \apref{ap:spec_higgs}.

The original Higgs-Brout-Englert mechanism was demonstrated only for massive
QED; Kibble extended this idea to non-abelian
groups~\cite{kibble_symmetry_1967}. Weinberg~\cite{weinberg_model_1967}
and Salam~\cite{salam_weak_1968} applied Kibble's results to Glashow's
$\SU(2)\times\U(1)$ idea\footnote{And shared the 1979 Nobel for it.}. 
They demonstrated that one can generate masses
for weak gauge bosons along with electrons and muons, while still leaving
neutrinos massless. This approach also predicted neutral weak currents,
which were discovered shortly thereafter by the Gargamelle
experiment~\cite{hasert_observation_1974}. The $W$ and $Z$ bosons would
be discovered at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
in the early 1980s~\cite{aubert_ratio_1983,arnison_experimental_1983}.

Around this time, t'Hooft and Veltman
also showed\footnote{1999 Nobel prize for them.} these theories are
renormalizable~\cite{t_hooft_regularization_1972}; together the Higgs mechanism
and renormalizability of the SM allow one to consistently generate gauge boson
masses while ensuring its applicability at all energy scales.
Furthermore CERN's 2012 discovery of the Higgs 
boson~\cite{aad_observation_2012,chatrchyan_observation_2012} shows that Higgs mechanism
corresponds to reality, rather than being just a mathematical trick to 
consistently approach massive elementary particles.


\subsection{Lepton mixing}

In 1963, Cabibbo introduced the {\it Cabibbo angle}\index{Cabibbo angle} allowing
for quark mixing in weak interactions~\cite{cabibbo_unitary_1963} to
explain the lifetimes of heavier hadrons. The suppression of flavor changing
neutral currents was explained in the early 1970s through the GIM\index{GIM mechanism}
mechanism~\cite{glashow_weak_1970}, but in order for this mechanism to work,
one needed full doublets of quarks and leptons.
Then Kobayashi and Maskawa predicted the existence of a third
generation~\cite{kobayashi_cp_1973}, since three quark generations are the
minimal amount needed to allow CP violation in the quark sector\footnote{They
shared the 2008 Nobel along with Nambu.}. The full quark mixing matrix
is known as the CKM matrix.\index{CKM matrix} Neutrino mixing is also handled
through a mixing matrix, the so-called PMNS matrix.\index{PMNS matrix} 
We discuss neutrino mixing in detail
in \apref{ap:spec_neutrino}.


\section{Introductory remarks about QFT} 

Here I just want to list some things that seem to be true about the universe,
and therefore our underlying theory should reflect these things. For example:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Causal influences seem to be {\it local}, i.e. there is no
        action-at-a-distance.
  \item Elementary particles are completely and perfectly indistinguishable.
\end{enumerate}
One way to make sense of these two points is to assume the existence of 
{\it fields},\index{field} math objects whose pre-image is all space-time.
That the field value depends on its space-time coordinate allows it to be local,
and all elementary particles are viewed as excitations of the field. Since all
particles are excitations of the same object, it is therefore unsurprising that
they would be indistinguishable.

Related to point (1) above, and as already mentioned in the introduction, we
would like our theories to have this property:
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item QFT should be consistent with special relativity.
\end{enumerate}
Demand (3) leads in part to the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, and from these
we will find that particle number is not conserved.
A fundamental QFT length scale can be heuristically derived from this statement 
as follows: Consider an elementary particle in a box of length $L$. By the 
uncertainty principle, we have
\begin{equation}
  \Delta p\gtrsim \hbar/2L,
\end{equation}
which means according to relativity,
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E\gtrsim \hbar c/2L.
\end{equation}
If the energy uncertainty is large enough, i.e. large enough to support a
particle-antiparticle pair, we conclude
\begin{equation}
  \Delta E\approx 2mc^2 \gtrsim\hbar c/2L.
\end{equation}
Appearing in this equation is the {\it Compton wavelength}\footnote{I guess if
one uses $\hbar$ instead of $h$ this is rather the {\it reduced} Compton
wavelength. But I somehow always work using $\hbar$ instead of $h$, so I opted
to abuse this convention a little.}\index{wavelength!Compton}
$\lambda_c=\hbar/mc$. This delivers an interpretation for the Compton wavelength:
\begin{equation}
  L \gtrsim \lambda_c/4
\end{equation}
is a distance threshold\footnote{I have also seen $\lambda_c/2$ as the threshold,
which comes when you think the energy uncertainty only has to be large enough to
support a single particle. But in QFT particles are always created from the
vacuum in particle-antiparticle pairs due to conservation laws.} below which 
you have to worry about QFT. Below this scale, you are likely to detect
particle-antiparticle pairs of the species you are examining, which you cannot
distinguish, and it becomes difficult to speak a unique particle at all. In that
sense the Compton wavelength gives a characteristic length scale for a
particle. One can compare this with the particle's de Broglie wavelength
\index{wavelength!de Broglie}$\lambda_v=\hbar/mv$, where it behaves in a well-defined way as a wave.


\section{The principle of stationary action}


This section follows a fairly well known and delightful lecture by Feynman
\cite{caltech}.

\index{limit!classical}\index{non-relativistic limit}
\section{The non-relativistic and classical limits}

In this section I briefly give some intuition for how mundane Newtonian
physics can be recovered from the more esoteric relativistic and quantum
theories. Namely \index{limit!non-relativistic} I want to focus on 
the following two phrases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The non-relativistic limit is $c\to\infty$.
  \item The classical limit is $\hbar\to0$.
\end{enumerate}
I don't think I have the understanding to prove anything, but at least I
can provide some ideas and examples that can make you believe these
two statements.

The non-relativistic limit is, I think, the easier to understand. When we
learn about relativity, the speed of light $c$ is taken as a ``cosmic speed
limit"; correspondingly, sending $c\to\infty$ lifts the speed limit, and
so perhaps it's not surprising that Galilean physics is recovered.
More explicitly, we can see what happens to the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ and
Einstein velocity addition formula under these limits. For the former
we find
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{c\to\infty}\gamma
  =\lim_{c\to\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}=1,
\end{equation}
i.e. there is no longer any time dilation or length contraction.
Meanwhile when $c\gg v$, we find for the velocity addition formula 
\begin{equation}
  v_1\oplus v_2
  =\frac{v_1/c + v_2/c}{1+v_1v_2/c^2}
  \approx \frac{v_1}{c} + \frac{v_2}{c}, 
\end{equation}
i.e. it reduces to Galilean velocity addition.

For the classical limit, one can look at specific, simple examples, such as
the quantum harmonic oscillator. In QM, the energy levels of this system
are given by
\begin{equation}
  E_n=\hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
In the $\hbar\to0$ limit, one therefore sees that the differences in energy
become continuous rather than discrete. More generally one can look at
the Heisenberg uncertainty relation,
\begin{equation}
  \Delta p\Delta x\geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\end{equation}
and when $\hbar=0$, you are once again allowed to know position and
momentum simultaneously.

\section{The path integral}

\section{Discrete symmetries}\label{sec:discreteSymm}

\section{Isospin and hypercharge}\label{sec:isohyper}
\index{hypercharge}\index{isospin}

We follow Chapter~9 of 
Thomson~\cite{thomson_modern_2013}. 
In quantum mechanics you learn that spin is a quantum number of
charged particles. For example the electron is a spin-1/2 particle. The
$z$-component $S_3$ of the spin operator $S$ commutes with the Hamiltonian, and
you learn that the eigenvectors of $S_3$ are the +1/2 and -1/2 states. You also
learn that the components of $S$ are related to the Pauli matrices by
\begin{equation}
  S_i=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sigma_i.
\end{equation}

Early on in nuclear physics, scientists noticed that the proton and neutron had
about the same mass, and that the nuclear force between two nucleons (i.e.
protons or neutrons) was approximately charge independent. Therefore Heisenberg
suggested that protons and neutrons were two states of a single particle (the
nucleon) just as there are spin-up and spin-down states of a spin-1/2
particle.
The quantum number corresponding to this property is called {\it isospin}.
Using this idea, the proton and neutron form an isospin doublet with total
isospin $I=1/2$ and $z$-component $I_3=\pm1/2$. Thus the Pauli matrices also
give a suitable representation of the isospin operator, and we write
\begin{equation}
  I^2=\sum\limits_{i=1}^3 I_i^2, \qquad I_i=\frac{1}{2}\sigma_i.
\end{equation}
I know this is sloppy, but I want to leave it to the reader to determine from
context whether $I$ represents the operator or the eigenvalue. 

The concept of isospin can be extended in the same way to quarks. 
In the simplest case we have $N_f=2$ and consider the lightest quarks
$u$ and $d$. The $\SU(2)$ isospin symmetry is only approximate because 
the $u$ and $d$ quarks have slightly different masses. The isospin 
doublet then has a $u$ component and a $d$ component. Generally with
$N_f$ flavors of fermion with degenerate masses, the symmetry group is 
$\SU(N_f)$ and we
form $N_f$-component multiplets in flavor space, one component per flavor.

Let's introduce the $s$ quark, assuming it has the same mass as the
$u$ and $d$ quarks, and do the $N_f=3$ case.
Using the Pauli matrices and the fact that $\SU(3)$ has 8 generators, you can
figure out what the Gell-Mann matrices are. We will say that $u$, $d$, and $s$
are eigenvectors of isospin and write
\begin{equation}
  u=\colvec{3}{1}{0}{0}, \qquad
  d=\colvec{3}{0}{1}{0}, \qquad
  s=\colvec{3}{0}{0}{1}.
\end{equation}
Then $u$ and $d$ span a 2D subspace of flavor space, so from the earlier
discussion we should know that the generators of $\SU(2)$ are contained in the
generators of $\SU(3)$. Hence
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_1=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            0 & 1 &  \\
            1 & 0 &  \\
              &   & 0
            \end{array}\right), \qquad
  \lambda_2=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            0 & -i &  \\
            i & 0  &  \\
              &    & 0
            \end{array}\right), \qquad
  \lambda_3=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            1 & 0  &  \\
            0 & -1 &  \\
              &    & 0
            \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
But there's nothing special about $u$ and $d$; $u$ and $s$ will similarly form
a subspace, and so will $d$ and $s$. In both cases, we will use the Pauli
matrices as generators. We can similarly write
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_4=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            0 &   & 1\\
              & 0 &  \\
            1 &   & 0
            \end{array}\right), \qquad
  \lambda_5=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            0 &    & -i \\
              & 0  &    \\
            i &    & 0
            \end{array}\right), \qquad
  \lambda_X=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            1 &    & 0 \\
              & 0  &   \\
            0 &    & -1
            \end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_6=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            0 &   &  \\
              & 0 & 1\\
              & 1 & 0
            \end{array}\right), \qquad
  \lambda_7=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            0 &    &   \\
              & 0  & -i\\
              & i  & 0
            \end{array}\right), \qquad
  \lambda_Y=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
           0  &    &  \\
              & 1  & 0\\
              & 0  & -1 
            \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
Finally note the fact that there are only 8 linearly independent generators, so
two of these matrices should be linearly dependent. Since the
$u\leftrightarrow d$ isospin symmetry is the closest to being exact, we choose
the last generator to be a linear combination of $\lambda_X$ and $\lambda_Y$
that treats the $u$ and $d$ quarks symmetrically. Thus
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_8=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\lambda_X+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\lambda_Y
           =\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
            1 &   &   \\
              & 1 &   \\
              &   & -2
            \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
The new isospin and total isospin operators are
\begin{equation}
  I^2=\frac{1}{4}\sum\limits_{i=1}^8 I_i^2, \qquad I_i=\frac{1}{2}\lambda_i.
\end{equation}

In the case of $\SU(2)$, the operators $I_i$ do not commute, and therefore are
not simultaneously diagonalizable. For $\SU(3)$ in the Gell-Mann basis,
$I_3$ and $I_8$ are both diagonal, so they correspond to compatible
observables. The observable $I_3$ is itself sometimes referred to
as isospin or weak isospin. The observable we associate with $I_8$ is rescaled as
\begin{equation}
  Y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\lambda_8,
\end{equation}
and $Y$ is called the {\it hypercharge}.\index{hypercharge} 
We can quickly obtain the isopins and hypercharges of
our lightest quarks: 
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\hat{I_3}\,u =\frac{1}{2}u ~~~ &\text{and}~~~\hat{Y}u=\frac{1}{3}u,\\
\hat{I_3}\,d =-\frac{1}{2}d ~~~ &\text{and}~~~\hat{Y}d=\frac{1}{3}d,\\
\hat{I_3}\,s = 0           ~~~ &\text{and}~~~\hat{Y}s=-\frac{2}{3}s.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
One can summarize this pattern of conserved charges in the following formula:
\begin{theorem}{Gell-Mann-Nishijima Formula}{}
\index{Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula}
  The electric charge $Q$ of a particle is related to its isospin and
  hypercharge by
  \begin{equation*}
    Q=I_3+\frac{1}{2}Y
  \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}


\section{Spontaneous symmetry breaking}\label{sec:ssb}
\index{spontaneous symmetry breaking}
We follow Section~11.1 of Peskin and 
Schroeder~\cite{peskin_introduction_1995}.
Let $\phi(x)$ denote a vector (in the mathematical sense) of $N$ real,
scalar fields $\phi^i(x)$. Then the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \Lagr=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\mu\phi\right)^2
        +\frac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2-\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4
       \equiv\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\mu\phi\right)^2
        +V(\phi)
\end{equation}
is invariant under $O(N)$. (Recall orthogonal transformations are the
ones with $R^TR=\id$.) This is the Lagrangian of the {\it linear
sigma model}. Note that is is a generalization of $\phi^4$ theory,
but we have replaced the positive mass parameter $m^2$ with a
negative parameter $-\mu^2$ and rescaled $\lambda$ to eliminate a factor of 6.
Classically, the potential is minimized when $\phi$ lies
on an $N$-dimensional sphere of radius $\sqrt{\mu^2/\lambda}$, i.e. 
it is minimized for vectors $\phi_\text{min}$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
  \phi_\text{min}^2=\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}.
\end{equation}
To interpret the theory, we first choose coordinates so that 
$\phi_\text{min}$ lies
entirely along the $N$ direction
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phidir}
  \phi_\text{min}=(0,0,...,0,v),
\end{equation}
where $v=\sqrt{\mu^2/\lambda}$ is the {\it vacuum expectation value} or VEV.
Then, we define a set of shifted fields $\pi_k$ and $\sigma$ relative
to this point by writing
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phishift}
  \phi(x)=\left(\pi_1(x),\pi_2(x),...,\pi_{N-1}(x),v+\sigma(x)\right)
\end{equation}
Written in terms of $\pi$, the $N-1$ dimensional vector with components
$\pi_k$, and $\sigma$, the new Lagrangian becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:brokenlagr}
  \Lagr=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\mu\pi\right)^2
        +\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_\mu\sigma\right)^2
        -\frac{1}{2}\left(2\mu^2\right)\sigma^2-\sqrt{\lambda}\mu\sigma^3
        -\sqrt\mu\pi^2\sigma
        -\frac{\lambda}{4}\sigma^2
        -\frac{\lambda}{2}\pi^2\sigma^2
        -\frac{\lambda}{4}\pi^4,
\end{equation}
where we have removed constant terms, because they do not change the
physics. Equation~\eqref{eq:brokenlagr} is the Lagrangian of $N-1$
massless, dynamic fields $\pi_k$ and a dynamic field $\sigma$ with mass
$\sqrt{2}\mu$. Written in this form, the original $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry
is now obscured. There is a remaining $\text{O}(N-1)$ symmetry
rotating the $\pi_k$ among themselves. This is an example of
{\it spontaneous symmetry breaking} (SSB), and we say something like
``the original $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry spontaneously breaks to
the subgroup $\text{O}(N-1)$." 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figs/symm_break.pdf}
\caption{Linear sigma model potential for $N=2$. In (a) the $\phi$ field
         mass term $m^2>0$, while (b) gives this potential when
         $m^2$ is replaced by a negative parameter $-\mu^2$.
         Oscillations along the circle of minima in (b) correspond to 
         the $\pi$ field. Oscillations in the radial direction correspond
         to the $\sigma$ field. Image taken from 
         Thompson~\cite{thomson_modern_2013}.}
\label{fig:ssb}
\end{figure}

Let's try to gain some geometric intuition for this phenomenon. 
Looking at \equatref{eq:phidir}, we see that in $\phi$ space, the $\sigma$
field corresponds to oscillations of $\phi$ orthogonal to the $N-1$
dimensional hypersurface, while the massless $\pi_k$ fields
corresponds to oscillations along the hypersurface. 
An example with $N=2$ is shown in \figref{fig:ssb}. 
If we take the ground state vector~\eqref{eq:phidir} and hit it with
$\text{O}(N)$, it will be rotated somewhere else on the hypersurface.
The subgroup $\text{O}(N-1)$ hits the first $N-1$ components of the
ground state, which are all 0, thereby leaving it unchanged.
In the original $\phi^4$ theory with
$m^2>0$, the ground state vector was 0, so the $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry
was also a symmetry of the ground state. After SSB, $\text{O}(N)$ changes 
the ground state vector in general,
which is why we say the symmetry is broken. Generally any symmetry
respected by the Lagrangian but not by the ground state vector
is a broken symmetry.

In the linear sigma model, massless $\pi$ particles appeared after
SSB. This is a special example of a general result
known as Goldstone's theorem. The generated massless particles are
referred to as \index{Goldstone!boson}{\it Goldstone bosons}. 
Many light bosons can be interpreted
as approximate Goldstone bosons; as we will see in \secref{sec:cscont},
the pion can be viewed in this manner.
\begin{theorem}{Goldstone's theorem}{}
\index{Goldstone!theorem}
Consider a Lagrangian of the form
$$
  \Lagr=(\text{kinetic term for $\phi$})+
        (\text{terms independent of $\phi$})-V(\phi),
$$
where $\phi$ is the $N$-dimensional vector of real, scalar fields
$\phi_k$, and $\Lagr$ is invariant under a continuous, global
transformation of $\phi$ with generators $T^a$. Then for every
spontaneously broken generator there exists a corresponding
Goldstone boson. 
\begin{proof}
  Let $\phi_\text{min}$ be a constant field minimizing $V$. Expanding
  $V$ about this minimum we get to leading order
  $$
    V(\phi)= V(\phi_\text{min})
     +\frac{1}{2}
      (\phi-\phi_\text{min})_i(\phi-\phi_\text{min})_j\,
      \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial\phi_i\partial\phi_j}
       \Big|_{\phi=\phi_\text{min}}.
  $$
  The differences $\phi-\phi_\text{min}$ give the new fields of the
  theory after SSB; for example in the linear sigma model this difference
  is, from \equatref{eq:phidir} and \eqref{eq:phishift},
  $$
    \phi-\phi_\text{min}=(\pi_1,...,\pi_{N-1},\sigma).
  $$
  Therefore the coefficient of the quadratic term is a symmetric matrix
  whose eigenvalues give the masses of these fields. If we can prove
  that each broken generator implies a zero eigenvalue for this matrix,
  we are done.
  The kinetic term for $\phi$ is already invariant under the global
  transformation, so if $\Lagr$ is invariant, it follows that $V$ must
  be as well. Then we can write
  $$
    V\left((\id-i\omega^aT^a)\phi\right)=V(\phi),
  $$
  where $\omega$ is some infinitesimal parameter. Expanding to linear
  order yields
  $$
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial\phi_j}(T^a\phi)_j=0.
  $$
  Differentiating the above with respect to $\phi_i$ and evaluating at
  $\phi_\text{min}$ gives
  $$
     \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial\phi_i\partial\phi_j}
      \Big|_{\phi=\phi_\text{min}}(T^a\phi_\text{min})_j=0,
  $$
  i.e. $T^a\phi_\text{min}$ is annihilated by the mass matrix. 
  If $T^a$ is a broken generator, we have $T^a\phi_\text{min}\neq0$,
  so the above equation implies $T^a\phi_\text{min}$ is an
  eigenvector of the mass matrix with eigenvalue zero.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}




\section{The GMOR formula}

The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Oakes-Renner (GMOR) formula~\cite{gell-mann_behavior_1968}
relates the pion mass to the masses of the up and down quarks. I think
this formula is derivable in chiral perturbation theory. The formula
takes the form
\begin{equation}
  M_\pi^2= B(m_u+m_d)+\order{m^2}.
\end{equation}
This formula directly shows that the pion mass is not simply the sum of
the valence quark masses. Moreover since you know the physical values
of $M_\pi$, $m_u$, and $m_d$, this equation can be used to crudely estimate
$M_\pi$ for unphysical light quark masses.




\section{Chiral symmetry}\label{sec:cscont}
\index{chiral symmetry}


In this section we work with a Euclidean metric. We follow
Chapter 7 of Gattringer and
Lang~\cite{gattringer_quantum_2010}.

The massless fermion action for a single flavor reads
\begin{equation}
S_F=\int\dd[4]{x}\Lagr_F=\int\dd[4]{x}\bar{\psi}\slashed{D}\psi. 
\end{equation}
We refer to $\slashed{D}$ as the {\it massless Dirac operator}. A
\index{rotation!chiral}
{\it chiral rotation}\footnote{You may notice that the sign in the exponent
is the same for both the spinor field and its conjugate field. This is a
common feature whenever a $\gamma_5$ is in the exponent. Recall that
$\bar{\psi}=\psi^\dagger\gamma_4$. The $\gamma_5$ will anticommute with
$\gamma_4$.} of the fermion fields is a transformation
mapping
\begin{equation}
  \psi\to e^{i\alpha\gamma_5}\psi~~~~\text{and}~~~~
  \bar{\psi}\to\bar\psi e^{i\alpha\gamma_5},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha\in\R$. This is probably called a chiral rotation
because $\gamma_5$ is used to define the operators~\eqref{eq:projdef},
which project out the left-handed and right-handed components of the
fermion field according to \equatref{eq:projact}. Using identity 2 of
\propref{prp:gammatech}, we find that $\Lagr_F$ transforms under this
rotation as
\begin{equation}
  \Lagr_F\to\bar{\psi}e^{i\alpha\gamma_5}\slashed{D}e^{i\alpha\gamma_5}\psi
         =\bar{\psi}e^{i\alpha\gamma_5}e^{-i\alpha\gamma_5}\slashed{D}\psi
         =\Lagr_F,
\end{equation}
i.e. it is invariant under chiral rotations. Using
\propref{prp:projection}, one can decompose $\Lagr_F$ into its
left-handed and right-handed parts as
\begin{equation}
  \Lagr_F=\bar{\psi}_L\slashed{D}\psi_L
         +\bar{\psi}_R\slashed{D}\psi_R,
\end{equation}
and we colloquially say that the chiral components of
$\Lagr_F$ ``do not talk to each other."
If one were to include a mass term in $\Lagr_F$, it would decompose as
\begin{equation}
  m\bar{\psi}\psi=m\left(\bar{\psi}_R\psi_L+\bar{\psi}_L\psi_R\right),
\end{equation}
which mixes the chiral components, thereby breaking chiral symmetry.
\index{limit!chiral}
This is why one refers to the limit $m\to0$ as the {\it chiral limit}.




We now generalize these ideas to $N_f$ flavors of fermion. In Gattringer
and Lang eq.~(7.11), they write the fermion action as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nfact}
  S_F=\int\dd[4]{x}\Lagr_F=\int\dd[4]{x}
         \bar{\psi}\left(\slashed{D}+M\right)\psi,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the {\it mass matrix}\index{mass matrix}
\begin{equation}
  M~``="~\diag(m_1,m_2,...,m_{N_f})
\end{equation}
acting in flavor space. $M$ cannot be a $N_f\times N_f$ matrix, because
we have defined $\gamma^\mu$ as a $4\times4$ matrix. The only way adding
these matrices makes sense is if $M$ is a $4N_f\times4N_f$ matrix, i.e. if
\begin{equation}
  M=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
      m_1\id_4 &          &        & \\
               & m_2\id_4 &        & \\
               &          & \ddots & \\
               &          &        & m_{N_f}\id_4
    \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
Then $\psi$ must be a $4N_f$ vector (in the mathematical sense, not
in the Lorentz transformation sense) looking something like
\begin{equation}
  \psi=\colvec{4}{\psi_1}{\psi_2}{\vdots}{\psi_{N_f}},
\end{equation}
where each $\psi_i$ is a 4-component Dirac spinor, and presumably when
we write $\gamma^\mu$ in \equatref{eq:nfact} what we really mean is
\begin{equation}
  \gamma^\mu=\gamma^\mu\id_{N_f}
            =\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
               \gamma^\mu &            &        & \\
                          & \gamma^\mu &        & \\
                          &            & \ddots & \\
                          &            &        & \gamma^\mu
               \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
I pray the reader forgives the notational perversion in the above equation.


In the chiral limit, the action \equatref{eq:nfact} is again invariant under
\index{rotation!axial vector}
chiral rotations, also in this context called {\it axial vector rotations},
taking the form
\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:SUNfc}
  \psi\to e^{i\alpha\gamma_5 T^a}\psi,\qquad
    \bar{\psi}\to\bar{\psi}e^{i\alpha\gamma_5 T^a}, \\
  \label{eq:U1A}
  \psi\to e^{i\alpha\gamma_5 \id}\psi,\qquad
    \bar{\psi}\to\bar{\psi}e^{i\alpha\gamma_5 \id},
\end{gather}
where the $T^a$ are the $N_f^2-1$ generators of $\SU(N_f)$,
$\id\equiv\id_{4N_f}$, and again $\alpha\in\R$.
In this limit the action is also invariant under the
\index{rotation!vector}
{\it vector rotations}
\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:SUNf}
  \psi\to e^{i\alpha T^a}\psi,\qquad
    \bar{\psi}\to\bar{\psi}e^{-i\alpha T^a}, \\
  \label{eq:U1V}
  \psi\to e^{i\alpha \id}\psi,\qquad
    \bar{\psi}\to\bar{\psi}e^{-i\alpha \id}.
\end{gather}
This invariance under the above two equations extends to the case of degenerate
masses, when $m_1=m_2=...=m_{N_f}\equiv m$, and is the familiar isospin
symmetry generalized to $N_f$ flavors. The symmetry~\eqref{eq:U1V} holds for
\index{baryon number}
arbitrary masses, and the conserved quantity is the 
{\it baryon number}\footnote{You can see why it's called baryon number: 
A baryon is made of 3
quarks, and hence has $B=1$. Anti-quarks have $B=-1$, and
mesons have $B=0$.}
\begin{equation}
    B=\frac{1}{3}(n_q-n_{\bar{q}}).
\end{equation}


Returning once again to the massless limit, the invariance of the action under
\equatref{eq:SUNfc}, \eqref{eq:U1A}, \eqref{eq:SUNf}, and \eqref{eq:U1V}
represents the global symmetry group
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SMfglobal}
  \SU(N_f)_L\times\SU(N_f)_R\times\U(1)_V\times\U(1)_A.
\end{equation}
Breaking the global symmetry group~\eqref{eq:SMfglobal} has important
implications in QCD phenomenology. For example we will show that in the
quantized, massless theory the fermion determinant changes
under~\equatref{eq:U1A}, breaking the $\U(1)_A$ symmetry explicitly. The remaining
symmetry is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SMglobalbUA}
  \SU(N_f)_L\times\SU(N_f)_R\times\U(1)_V.
\end{equation}
If the fermion masses are degenerate, the symmetry $\SU(N_f)_L\times\SU(N_f)_R$
breaks to its subgroup $\SU(N_f)_V$. Now the remaining symmetry is
\begin{equation}
  \SU(N_f)_V\times\U(1)_V.
\end{equation}
Finally allowing non-degenerate masses breaks the symmetry further.
There remains
\begin{equation}
  \underbrace{\U(1)_V\times\U(1)_V\times...\times\U(1)_V}_\text{$N_f$ times}.
\end{equation}


The typical QCD scale is $\sim1~\text{GeV}$ (think protons, which have a
mass of about 940~MeV) so the $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks have masses that
are relatively small (about 5~MeV, 5~MeV, and 100~MeV, respectively).
Since these masses are so close to zero on this scale, we can say that
when $N_f=2$, and partly for $N_f=3$, \equatref{eq:SMglobalbUA} is
an approximate symmetry. If the $u$ and $d$ quarks were massless, this symmetry
would be exact, and it can be argued~\cite{gattringer_quantum_2010} that
a nucleon and its negative parity partner should have the same mass.
However one finds the negative parity nucleon to have
a mass of about 1535~MeV, and this difference of about 600~MeV is too large to
be explained by the slight breaking due to the $u$ and $d$ masses. We
conclude that something else is happening. This is another example
of SSB: If quarks were massless, the pions would arise as
the Goldstone bosons of chiral SSB; hence we refer to pions as
``would-be" Goldstone bosons.
