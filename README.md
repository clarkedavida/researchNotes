# researchNotes
This "book" is a collection of research notes that I made while researching in physics. The first chapters are dedicated to mainly mathematics, and the last chapters are dedicated to mainly physics, with an aim toward lattice field theory. A collection of appendices includes supplementary information that didn't seem to fit in any existing chapter.

You can look into the 0_researchnotes.tex files to see what packages this uses, but I think if you install texlive-full, you should have all the packages you need.

This compiles with ./makelatex. Feel free to make an Issue if you have any problems!
